# To setup a flask project
# Tips from Pipenv: https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
# 1. pip install pipenv in project folder terminal

# 2. pipenv install flask iin project folder terminal

#***Optional NOTE*** If your receive an error using pipenv,
#you may need to import it as a module first before
# it can be run as a script. You can do so using 
# the -m flag as below. You will need to do this
#  every time you use pipenv.
# python -m pipenv <command to use>

#Once we have installed the Flask package, we need
#to activate our environment in order to use it. We
# can achieve this with the following command.
# 3. pipenv shell

# Once in shell, activate the server via script call.  
# This must be ran from the project folder where the
# server.py is located. Go to # 6 when ready to exit
# 4. python server.py

#***If needing to see packages***
#To check what is installed in your virtual environment,
#with your virtual environment activated (pipenv shell),
# you can type the command, pip list and you will see a
#  list of what is currently installed.
# pip list

#To deactivate the virtual environment we can use exit.
#Our bash window should look something like this.
# 5. exit or ctrl + c
